# journies-blog

##Live
The live version of this repo is hosted on heroku at [Stoic Developer](https://stoic-developer.herokuapp.com).
Be sure to read my articles if you're into that kind of stuff.

In retrospect I probably should have used Wordpress if I wanted a serious blog, but its been a good learning experience to build a one on React.

##Usage in development
Clone this repo, then run

```
npm install
npm start
```
